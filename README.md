### Hi there 👋

I'm Timur Gainullin, a junior golang developer with a passion for competitive programming 🚀. I'm always expanding my skills and exploring new interests in AI 🤖, microservices 🐳 and Go🐹.

#### Accompaniment Generator for Songs 🎶: [kaggle.com/code/tumypmyp/accompaniment-generation](https://www.kaggle.com/code/tumypmyp/accompaniment-generation)

Love this Intro to AI class project. In my solution, I utilized the Evolutionary Algorithm. The main scoring function for a possible accompaniment is based on a musical intervals formula. If the interval is a consonance, it adds points, and if it's a dissonance, it subtracts points from considered solution. After several iterations, almost no dissonances exist between the melody and accompaniment, making it theoretically more pleasing to the ear.
